# credible-domains.org

An informational website to clear up a common misconception about .org domains and provide examples
of special TLDs with identity verification.

## Listing

For a TLD to be listed, it needs to have a "URL for registration services" available in
the [IANA Root Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db). The website given by that URL
needs to have an easily findable policy on who is eligible to register a domain and state that
eligibility is checked before registration is complete. It also can not be one of the hundreds of
trademark TLDs, because there are just too many for one person to manually manage.

If you know of a missing TLD that meets the requirements above, please open an issue.
